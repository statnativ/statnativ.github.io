# About Me

Hi there! I'm Amit Tiwari, a Senior Staff Software Architect with over 16 years of experience at the intersection of enterprise architecture, AI innovation, and digital transformation.

## My Professional Journey

As an AI Enablement and Transformation Architect at GE HealthCare, I lead groundbreaking projects that leverage cutting-edge technologies to solve complex healthcare challenges. I've designed and implemented systems like the Digital Health Service Assistant and RADGeni (Rapid Application Development using Gen AI), which integrate advanced LLMs such as ChatGPT-4, Claude, and Llama with healthcare-specific data to create powerful, HIPAA-compliant solutions.

My work spans the full technology spectrum—from architecting distributed GPU-powered inference systems to developing cross-platform mobile applications that streamline field service operations. I'm particularly passionate about creating AI systems that enhance human capabilities rather than replace them, focusing on practical applications that deliver measurable results.

Before joining GE HealthCare, I honed my skills at IBM India and Fujitsu Consulting, where I led critical enterprise implementations for global clients like Honda Motors and Citibank. These experiences taught me how to bridge business requirements with technical solutions—a skill that continues to define my approach today.

## My Technical Philosophy

I believe in building systems that are:
- **Scalable**: Designed for growth from day one
- **Adaptive**: Flexible enough to evolve with changing requirements
- **Innovative**: Pushing boundaries while delivering practical value
- **Human-centered**: Enhancing capabilities and simplifying complex workflows

As an AWS Certified Solutions Architect, I approach each project with a cloud-native mindset while ensuring that the technology serves the business—not the other way around.

## Beyond the Code

My passion for technology extends beyond my day job. I've founded three technical communities at GE HealthCare: the AI Innovator Guild, DT Tech Café, and DT Shodhnum (a training initiative for digital transformation). I believe in sharing knowledge and building communities that foster innovation.

When I'm not architecting systems or mentoring teams, you'll find me exploring the latest developments in AI, experimenting with new frameworks, or thinking about how technology can solve the next big challenge in healthcare.

## Let's Connect

I'm always open to connecting with fellow technologists, healthcare professionals, or anyone interested in the intersection of AI and enterprise architecture. Feel free to reach out—I'd love to exchange ideas!
