# Introduction to Deep Learning

This is a test blog post to demonstrate the automated blog publishing system for StatNativ.

## Key Features

- **Automated Processing**: The script automatically processes markdown files
- **Jekyll Compatibility**: Generates proper frontmatter for Jekyll
- **Git Integration**: Pushes changes to GitHub Pages automatically

## Code Example

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

## Conclusion

This automated system will help streamline the blog publishing process for StatNativ, making it easier to convert draft markdown files into published blog posts.
